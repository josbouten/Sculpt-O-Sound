# Install Vocode-O-Matic from source
# ==================================

# Install the Rack-SDK and set the env variable RACK_DIR
# For the 1.1.5 SDK have a look at this:

# https://community.vcvrack.com/t/rack-development-blog/5864/37

# Download the latest version of Vocode-O-Matic from https://github.com/josbouten/Sculpt-O-Sound
# or check it out from github

# Go to your projects dir:

cd project

# and pull the code:

git pull https://github.com/josbouten/Sculpt-O-Sound

cd Sculpt-O-Sound

# Next get the code Vocode-O-Matic uses from SynthDevKit (e.g. for its CV-inputs) like so:

git submodule update --init --recursive

# This will create some output similar to this:

# Submodule 'SynthDevKit' (https://github.com/JerrySievert/SynthDevKit.git) registered for path 'SynthDevKit'
# Cloning into '/Users/jos/projects/Rack/plugins/Sculpt-O-Sound/SynthDevKit'...
# Submodule path 'SynthDevKit': checked out '3eb70748b12d1965963b80dfde7a33f516d19a7f'

# Then compile the code using:

RACK_DIR=/Users/<your_user_name_here>/projects/Rack-SDK make

# This should not take very long.
# You can speed this up supplying a number of cores you want 'make' to use in parallel:

# RACK_DIR=/Users/<your_user_name_here>/projects/Rack-SDK make -j 4

# Now go to the VCV Rack SDK dir and run Rack using:

make run
